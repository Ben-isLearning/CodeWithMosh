    <h1>CSS Best Practices</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Follow a Naming Convention - Consistently!</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        1) Kebab Case - Seperate Multiple words with hypthens. <br />
        like-this-you-see <br /><br />
        <strong>
          2) Camel Case - Starts with a lower case, but each word after is
          capitalized. <br />
          camelCaseLooksLikeThis <br />
        </strong>
        <br />
        3) Pascal Case - Starts with capitalization, continues. <br />
        PascalCaseLooksLikeThis <br /><br />

        4) Underscore Case - seperate words with _ <br />
        looks_like_this_takes_ages_to_type <br /><br />
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Create Logical Sections in Stylesheet</h2>
      <p>
        Even for large projects, split Style Sheets into multiples and access
        them via SASS <br /><br />
        1) Basic Styles <br />
        Setting incredibly broad rules... *{} | html{} | body{} | box-sizing:
        <br />
        <br />

        2) Typography <br />
        Setting styles for h1 - h6 <br /><br />

        3) Forms <br />
        Setting styles for input fields <br /><br />

        4) Navigation Bar <br />
        Setting styles for Nav bars <br /><br />

        Cluster sections together with appropreate notes. <br />
        Ideally we will be able to copy and paste <br />
        Line A - B of HTML and line X - Y of CSS and have it behave as expected.
        <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Avoid Overspecific Selectors</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>div.nav > ul.items > li {} </strong>(Specificity 23)<br />
        Is an incredibly specific selector, which is incredibly hard to
        maintain. <br />
        And will certainly break with changes. <br />
        <br />
        *Avoid child selectors where we can* <br />
        *Avoid type of elements* <br />
        *Create meaningful classes* <br />

        By removing the structural and relationship aspects, and creating a
        meaningful class, <br />
        The above code can become; <br />
        <br />
        <strong>.nav-item{}</strong> (Specificity 10) <br />
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Avoid !important</h2>
      <p>
        If we need to use !important to make something work as intended, <br />
        We've broken something elsewhere by making it too specific. <br />
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Sort Lines Ascending</h2>
      <p>
        Highlight CSS Codeblock <br />
        Crtl + Shift + P >> Sort Lines Ascending <br />
        <br />
        Take advantage of Style inheritance. <br />
        Style an upper element, and let the style cascade through the children
        <br />
        <br />
        Extract Repetitive Patterns <br />
        Object Oriented CSS <br />
        <br />
        Avoid Repetitive Values (Keep it DRY) <br />
        Dont Repeat Yourself. <br />
      </p>

Escape Sequences  (Escape Character)

Python recgonises " " or ' ' as the start and end of strings (Depending on what they start with)

string = "Ben said "I like cheese""      ~ Would result in an error 

The escape character \ will enable the next character to escape from the rules of python. 
Combining \ + " will create an escape sequence ~ \" 

string = "Ben said \"I like cheese\""

Formatted strings

The new way of combining strings is by formatting.

f"text goes here {variable here} more text or whatever you like" 

the value of the variables will be evaluated at runtime. 


first = "Ben" 
last = " likes code"

full = f"{first} really {last}"
>>Returns "Ben really likes code"



formatted strings can also contain functions and expressions. 


test = f"{len(first)} as well as {2 + 2}"
>>Returns 3 as well as 4

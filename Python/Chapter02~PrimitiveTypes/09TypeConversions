Type Conversions

Attempting to add "1" and 1 causes an error. 

Because it we could be asking two different things, and python cant do both (at the same time)

1 + 1 is fine

"1" + "1" is fine too.  >>we cant mix types. <<

But we can change them!!


int(x)      < Convert to Integer
float(x)    < Convert to float
bool(x)     < Convert to boolean 
stri(x)     < Convert to string

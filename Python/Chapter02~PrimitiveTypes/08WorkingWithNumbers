Working With Numbers;
Need to import math module!     <Almost like plugging in an extra memory stick full of data 
>Math module acts as an Object, as such methods can be called via dot notation 

"import math"


round()             < Rounds
abs()               < Returns absolute value (Can turn neg to pos)

math.ceil()         < Rounds up 
math.floor()        < Rounds down 

math.isnan()        < Checks if value is nan ~ Returns True if NaN otherwise False
math.isinf()        < Checks in value is infinite ~ True | False 

math.pi             < mathematical constant
